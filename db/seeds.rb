Title.create! name: "muir_woods",        description: "Muir Woods National Monument: is a unit of the National Park Service on the Pacific coast, 12 miles north of San Francisco, CA.  It protects 554 acres of which 240 acres are old growth Coast Redwood forests, one of a few such stands remaining in the San Francisco Bay Area.  On January 9, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the land a National Monument, the first to be created from land donated by a private individual.  It is named after the naturalist John Muir, whose environmental campaigns helped to establish the National Park system.  Before the logging industry came to California, there were an estimated 2 million acres of old growth forest containing redwoods growing in a narrow strip along the coast.  By the early 20th century, most of these forests had been cut down."
