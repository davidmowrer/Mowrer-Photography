The park itself contains the deepest and most dramatic section of the canyon.  The Gunnison River drops an average of 34 feet per mile through the entire canyon, making it the 5th steepest mountain descent in North America.  The Black Canyon is so named due its steepness which makes it difficult for sunlight to penetrate into its depths. As a result, the canyon is often shrouded in shadow, causing the rocky walls to appear black. At its narrowest point the canyon is only 40 feet wide at the river.  The extreme steepness and depth of the Black Canyon formed as the result of several geologic processes acting together."

The entire memorial covers 1,278.45 acres and is 5,725 feet above sea level.  Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of presidential greatness and has appeared in works of fiction, and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works. It attracts nearly three million people annually.  Construction on the memorial began in 1927 by Gutzon Borglum, and the presidents faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. Upon Gutzon Borglum's death in March 1941, his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction. In 1933 the National Park Service took over the project.  Dynamite blast removed approximately 450,000 tons of rock."

Yellowstone Lake is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.  Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism.  Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone."

A prominent feature of the 229 square mile park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles long and up to half a mile deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River. Ranging in elevation from 3,666 feet to 8,726 feet.  Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches.  In 1909, U.S. President William Howard Taft named the area a National Monument to protect the canyon, under the name of Mukuntuweap National Monument. In 1918, however, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service changed the park's name to Zion.  The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.  It was established as a National Park on November 19, 1919."

Guest came from Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Missouri, Washington and as far away as Germany.  For many this was the first time we had met.  We were able to trace our roots back to our Grandfathers, Great Grandfathers and for others Great, Great Grandfathers from Missouri.  I knew my grandfather, lived in Washington in the late 1800's, moved from Missouri with his brother.  He later moved and homesteaded in Ramah, New Mexico, as it was too wet in Washington. We had reunions with my Grandfathers descendants in Durango, Colorado, for several years until cousin Jimmy's cabin burnt down."
