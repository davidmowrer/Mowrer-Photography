				I have been interested in photography for most of my life.  I started
				using some old box camera that my parents had.  I remember when I 
				received a Polaroid camera for my birthday, when I was in the 6th
				grade.  I thought this was the best gift I had ever received!  My 
				first SLR film camera was a Minolta.  I later bought Minolta
				Maxxum 9 in 2003.  The digital cameras quickly were the camera to
				have.  I purchased Minolta's digital camera and in 2010, I upgraded to
				a new Sony digital camera.  I still shoot some film, but I am hooked
				on the digital cameras.  I consider myself an amateur photographer.
				I enjoy getting out and photographing whereever I go.  I find it
				very relaxing.  At times, I get lost in my world when I am out
				capturing my little piece of the world on film, or on a flash card.
				Where would we be without photographs?
